# Nuclear Electricity Statistics
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of nuclear electricity statistics across different regions of the world. The visualization focuses on three key aspects: the number of reactors, the total nuclear energy supplied, and the net energy capacity in each region. The goal is to offer insightful data that can help in understanding the global landscape of nuclear power and its contribution to the energy sector.

# Project Overview
Key Metrics:

Number of Reactors:

A visual representation of the total number of operational nuclear reactors in each region.
Helps in understanding the distribution and concentration of nuclear reactors globally.

Sum of Nuclear Energy Supplied:
